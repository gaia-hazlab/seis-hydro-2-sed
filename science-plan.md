# Seismic Monitoring of River Discharge and Bedload Transport  
## Analysis Plan for Discharge Modeling and Sediment Supply Diagnostics

### Scientific Motivation
Seismic stations located near rivers record high-frequency ground motion generated by river processes, including turbulent flow and bedload impacts. While discharge measurements \(Q(t)\) are available from river gauges that are not strictly co-located with seismic stations, seismic observations provide a unique opportunity to monitor **bedload transport efficiency and sediment supply variability**, especially following large floods and landslide-driven sediment pulses upstream.

The primary objective of this analysis is **not only to model discharge from seismic data**, but more importantly to **analyze residuals between seismic-based predictions and observed discharge** as indicators of changes in bedload transport, sediment supply, grain mobility, and channel state.

## Core Questions

1. How does band-limited seismic power scale with river discharge?
2. How stable is this scaling across multiple flood events?
3. What do systematic deviations (residuals) between seismic predictions and observed discharge tell us about:
   - bedload transport efficiency,
   - sediment supply from upstream landslides,
   - channel armoring or exhaustion effects?

---

## Conceptual Framework

Seismic power recorded near rivers can be written schematically as:

$$
P(f,t) \propto \int_{\text{river reach}} \left[ \text{Impact rate} \times \text{Impact impulse}^2 \right] \times |G(r,f)|^2 \, dr
$$

where:
- bedload impacts dominate higher-frequency bands,
- turbulent flow may dominate lower-frequency bands,
- \(G(r,f)\) is the frequency-dependent Green’s function (propagation and attenuation),
- the seismometer integrates contributions over a finite river reach.

Because discharge alone does not uniquely determine sediment transport, **residuals from discharge-based models contain critical physical information**.

## Data Description

### Seismic Data
- Continuous waveform data from stations located near river channels
- Sampling rate sufficient to resolve high-frequency (>10 Hz) signals
- Instrument responses available for removal

### Hydrologic Data
- River discharge time series \(Q(t)\) from gauging stations
- Gauges may be upstream or downstream of seismic stations

---

## Analysis Workflow

### 1. Seismic Preprocessing

- Remove instrument response (to ground velocity or acceleration)
- Detrend and de-mean waveforms
- Segment data into short windows (e.g., 30–120 s)
- Compute Power Spectral Densities (PSDs)
- Convert PSDs to band-limited seismic power:
  $$
  P_{f_1:f_2}(t) = \int_{f_1}^{f_2} PSD(f,t)\,df
  $$

### 2. Identification of Physically Meaningful Frequency Bands

Two frequency bands are typically identified:

- **Flow-dominated band**
  - Sensitive to turbulence and water motion
  - Often lower high-frequency band (site dependent)

- **Bedload-dominated band**
  - Sensitive to grain-bed impacts
  - Typically higher frequency
  - Exhibits strong activation near transport thresholds

Band selection is site-specific and determined empirically using:
- spectrograms during flood events,
- correlation with discharge,
- signal-to-noise behavior during dry periods.

---

### 3. Time Alignment with Discharge Measurements

Because gauges are not co-located with seismic stations:

- Estimate event-specific lags using:
  - cross-correlation between \(Q(t)\) and seismic band power,
  - or hydraulic travel-time estimates
- Allow lags to vary between events (celerity depends on stage)

---

### 4. Distance and Propagation Considerations

Seismic amplitudes depend on distance and attenuation between river sources and the station.

Initial strategy:
- Use **station-specific empirical scaling factors** calibrated during reference events
- Treat propagation effects as constant per station and frequency band

Optional refinement:
- Apply simplified geometric spreading and attenuation models
- Use multiple stations (if available) to constrain distance effects

---

### 5. Discharge Modeling from Seismic Data

A baseline discharge model is constructed primarily as a reference:

\[
\log Q(t - \tau) = a \log P_{\text{flow}}(t) + b \log P_{\text{bed}}(t) + c
\]

Model options:
- linear or robust regression,
- generalized additive models,
- machine learning regressors (with care).

**Key principle:**  
The discharge model is not the final product; it is a baseline used to compute expected seismic behavior.

---

### 6. Residual Analysis (Primary Scientific Output)

Define seismic residuals relative to observed discharge:

\[
\Delta(t) = \log P_{\text{bed}}(t) - \left( \alpha \log Q(t) + \beta \right)
\]

Residuals are interpreted as **changes in bedload transport efficiency per unit discharge**.

#### Physical Interpretation of Residuals

- **Positive residuals** (excess seismic power):
  - increased sediment supply,
  - finer or more mobile grains,
  - post-landslide sediment pulses,
  - reduced bed armoring.

- **Negative residuals** (deficit in seismic power):
  - sediment exhaustion,
  - increased armoring or coarsening,
  - transport shifting away from the station’s effective reach.

---

### 7. Event-Based and Temporal Diagnostics

For each flood event:
- Compute peak and mean residuals above transport thresholds
- Analyze hysteresis between \(P_{\text{bed}}\) and \(Q\)
- Track residual evolution across successive floods

Expected signatures:
- elevated residuals during first post-landslide floods,
- decay toward baseline as sediment supply is depleted,
- renewed anomalies indicating delayed or secondary sediment delivery.

---

## Key Scientific Outcomes

This framework enables:
- continuous monitoring of bedload dynamics without direct sediment sampling,
- detection of sediment supply changes following landslides,
- separation of hydraulic forcing (discharge) from sediment availability,
- identification of channel state transitions (armor break-up, exhaustion).

Residuals, rather than absolute discharge predictions, are the primary diagnostic linking seismic observations to geomorphic processes.

---

## Notes and Limitations

- Absolute inversion to sediment flux requires assumptions about grain size and impact physics
- Propagation effects limit inter-station comparability without calibration
- Interpretation benefits from complementary observations (landslides, imagery, grain size surveys)
